# Ömercan Balandı

I'm 23 years old passionate developer who is studying *computer science* at *dokuz eylul university*.


I'm interested in *front-end development*. I can create web apps using **React** and **Vue**. I enjoy creating stuff using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **NodeJS**. I made some [demos](https://codepen.io/obsfx/full/zYYGowP) that were picked as featured stuff and presented on the main page of [codepen](https://codepen.io/obsfx).


Besides the front-end development, I love creating [simple games](https://obsfx.itch.io/medieval-express) for [game jams](https://ldjam.com/users/omercanbalandi/games) and making convenient [command-line tools](https://github.com/obsfx/libgen-downloader) to make things easier for me.


I love using **Neovim**.

# Experience

- `Junior Front-end Developer - Radity February 2021 - May 2021`
  I worked on several **React** and **Vue/Nuxt** projects. I maintained legacy codebases and helped the team for implementing the new features.
