I'm 22 years old passionate developer who is studying *computer science* at *dokuz eylul university*.



I'm interested in *front-end development*. I am currently learning *React*. I enjoy creating stuff using ![](/home/obsfx/Desktop/obsfx.github.io/static/imgs/js.jpg) *JavaScript*, ![](/home/obsfx/Desktop/obsfx.github.io/static/imgs/ts.jpg) *TypeScript* and ![](/home/obsfx/Desktop/obsfx.github.io/static/imgs/njs.jpg) *NodeJS*. I made some [*demos*](https://codepen.io/obsfx/full/zYYGowP) that was picked as featured stuff and presented at the main page of [*codepen*](https://codepen.io/obsfx). Beside of the front-end development, I really love creating [*simple games*](https://obsfx.itch.io/medieval-express) for [*game jams*](https://ldjam.com/users/omercanbalandi/games) and making convenient [*command-line tools*](https://github.com/obsfx/libgen-downloader) to make things more easier to me.
